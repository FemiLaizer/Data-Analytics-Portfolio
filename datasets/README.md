# Dataset 
Here, I show the sample data I used to create the projects in this repository. 

---
For the 'Customer_Complaints', I used escalation data generated from ramdon customers about equipment they bought and use.
The reason for this project is to show escalation trends and the period escalations pends with teams before resolution.
This insight will help drive efficeincy, customer satisfaction and enhance exemptional service delivery of the company.
It will also increase company revenue by resource allocation by channeling assets toward region with high level escalations
and as well mitigate risk of failure of equipments by knowing the reoccurence faults.

For the 'Superstore', I used sample data downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final
to provide insight into the Customers, Products and Regions by the Sales improvement and profit margin to share how the 
effectiveness of each product based on location and top priority customers based on their order in the year trend.
